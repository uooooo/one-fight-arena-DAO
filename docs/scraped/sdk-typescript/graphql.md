# SuiGraphQLClient

SuiGraphQLClient is still in development and may change rapidly as it is being developed.

The `SuiGraphQLClient` can be used for reading and writing data directly, but deeper integration
into other SDKs is not ready yet. In a future release, GraphQL clients will be able to be passed
into any Mysten SDK method that currently accepts a JSON-RPC client.

To support GraphQL Queries, the Typescript SDK includes the `SuiGraphQLClient` which can help you
write and execute GraphQL queries against the Sui GraphQL API that are type-safe and easy to use.
For more details on the Sui GraphQL API, see the
[GraphQL reference](https://docs.sui.io/references/sui-graphql).

## [Writing your first query](#writing-your-first-query)

We'll start by creating our client, and executing a very basic query:

```
import { SuiGraphQLClient } from '@mysten/sui/graphql';
import { graphql } from '@mysten/sui/graphql/schemas/latest';

const gqlClient = new SuiGraphQLClient({
	url: 'https://graphql.testnet.sui.io/graphql',
});

const chainIdentifierQuery = graphql(`
	query {
		chainIdentifier
	}
`);

async function getChainIdentifier() {
	const result = await gqlClient.query({
		query: chainIdentifierQuery,
	});

	return result.data?.chainIdentifier;
}
```

## [Type-safety for GraphQL queries](#type-safety-for-graphql-queries)

You may have noticed the example above does not include any type definitions for the query. The
`graphql` function used in the example is powered by [`gql.tada`](https://gql-tada.0no.co/) and will
automatically provide the required type information to ensure that your queries are properly typed
when executed through `SuiGraphQLClient`.

The `graphql` function itself is imported from a versioned schema file, and you should ensure that
you are using the version that corresponds to the latest release of the GraphQL API.

The `graphql` also detects variables used by your query, and will ensure that the variables passed
to your query are properly typed.

```
const getSuinsName = graphql(`
	query getSuiName($address: SuiAddress!) {
		address(address: $address) {
			defaultSuinsName
		}
	}
`);

async function getDefaultSuinsName(address: string) {
	const result = await gqlClient.query({
		query: getSuinsName,
		variables: {
			address,
		},
	});

	return result.data?.address?.defaultSuinsName;
}
```

## [Using typed GraphQL queries with other GraphQL clients](#using-typed-graphql-queries-with-other-graphql-clients)

The `graphql` function returns document nodes that implement the
[TypedDocumentNode](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-typed-document-node) standard, and will
work with the majority of popular GraphQL clients to provide queries that are automatically typed.

```
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const chainIdentifierQuery = graphql(`
	query {
		chainIdentifier
	}
`);

function ChainIdentifier() {
	const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(getPokemonsQuery);

	return <div>{data?.chainIdentifier}</div>;
}
```
