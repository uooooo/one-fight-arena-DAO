Install Sui TypeScript SDK

# Install Sui TypeScript SDK

The Sui TypeScript SDK is available in the
[Sui TS SDK monorepo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks) and NPM.

## [Install from NPM](#install-from-npm)

To use the Sui TypeScript SDK in your project, run the following command in your project root:

```
npm i @mysten/sui
```

## [Experimental tag for use with a local Sui network](#experimental-tag-for-use-with-a-local-sui-network)

Projects developing against one of the on-chain Sui networks (Devnet, Testnet, Mainnet) should use
the base SDK published in the NPM registry (previous section) because the code aligns with the
relevant JSON-RPC. If your developing against a
[local network](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network) built from the
`main` branch of the Sui monorepo, however, you should use the `experimental`-tagged SDK package as
it contains the latest features (or a local build detailed in the section that follows).

```
npm i @mysten/sui@experimental
```

## [Install from local build](#install-from-local-build)

To build the SDK from the Sui monorepo, you must use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). With pnpm installed,
run the following command from the `sui` root directory:

```
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
# Run the build for the TypeScript SDK
pnpm sdk build
```

With the SDK built, you can import the library from your `sui` project. To do so, use a path to the
`ts-sdks/packages/typescript` directory that is relative to your project. For example, if you
created a folder `my-sui-project` at the same level as `sui`, use the following to import the
locally built Sui TypeScript package:

```
pnpm add ../ts-sdks/packages/typescript
```
